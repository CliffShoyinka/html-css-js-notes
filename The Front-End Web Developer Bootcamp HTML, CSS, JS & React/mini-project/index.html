                The passage experienced a surge in popularity during
                the 1960s when Letraset used it on their dry-transfer sheets,
                and again during the 90s as desktop publishers bundled
                the text with their software. Today it's seen all around the web;
                on templates, websites, and stock designs. Use our generator to get your own,
